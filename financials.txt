There are obvious milestones to hit:


-Working MVP
-first Client
-10 clients in a week
-100 clients in a week


Estimating the average revenue per session is $10:

To make $1 million = 100,000 sessions.
To do that in one year:
100,000 sessions / (52 weeks/yr) = 1924 sessions / week

That is a lot, but not unfeasible.
